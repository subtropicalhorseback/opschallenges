# Prompt the user for a directory to search in.
# recursively scan each file and folder in the user input directory path and print it to the screen.
# For each file scanned within the scope of your search directory:
## Generate the fileâ€™s MD5 hash using Hashlib.
## Assign the MD5 hash to a variable.
## Print the variable to the screen along with a timestamp, file name, file size, and complete (not symbolic) file path.
# At the end of the search process, print to the screen how many files were searched and how many hits were found.
# The script must successfully execute on both Ubuntu and Windows 10
# Add logging capabilities to this script.  All data output to the screen should also append to a log file.
