# Instructions
# Overview
## Time stamping is a critical step in automating log generation. Today, you will manipulate a variable in bash to apply todayâ€™s date to a log file.

# Objectives
## Create a bash script that:
   # Copies /var/log/syslog to the current working directory
   # Appends the current date and time to the filename

# For shell scripts, format your code according to the shell style guide linked above.

# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
   # Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.
   # Include in your bash script some timestamped echo statements telling the user what is happening at each stage of the script.
